      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="mee.jpg">
      <p>My name is Tanav Chandra. I am 9 years and 11 months old. I was born in Boston, Massachusetts and I grew up in Boston for 4 years. You might be wondering where I moved. I moved to Gainesville, Florida. When I moved to Florida, I did not like it. Since I was used to the cold, I would get too bored because it was too hot and it barely snows in the winter. I started playing golf when I was three and when we moved to Florida, my dad started training me for golf tournaments at the age of 5. When I grew up, I started playing golf tournaments at the age of 7 1/2. I would either get 3rd, first, or sixth. Now on this day, 5/4/2025, I now always get first place in tournaments.</p>

      <h2>My Passions</h2>
      <p>My passions are being an entrepreneur, app developer, and a professional golfer. Being an entrepreneur inspires me from my brother. My brother has a passion for coding and that inspired me. He also made a total of 3 apps and one of them failed, and by that time I wanted to be an engineer, professional golfer, and an app developer.</p>

            <p>Golf is a hard sport. It can take months and years to perfect the shot. Lucky for me, I played golf for 7 years and can hit it properly. It will slowly be fun right when you master it. So far I have been playing well and I am now the tour champion. The person who was jumping is a pro LIV golfer, the long drive champion, and the US Open champion. The US Open was at Pinehurst, North Carolina. Next year I am playing the world championship where the US Open was held.</p>

            <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" and "doubles".

            <p>Basketball is a pretty easy sport when you first start. You might think you just dribble, pass, and shoot into the net. But when you play against pros, their defense can be really hard. When the pros were kids, they practiced a lot shooting with one hand, just 1 foot away from the basket. It helps them shoot straighter and form better two-hand shots.</p>
